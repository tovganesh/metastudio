MeTA Studio is programmable IDE tailored for a computational chemist.
Main features include:

  * A programmable interface primarily through BeanShell with support for  [other languages](https://github.com/tovganesh/metastudio/blob/wiki/ProjectHome.md)
  * Workspace support
  * Visualization and Rendering (through JRman)
  * Support for 3-D scalar field visualization
  * Access to embedded Jmol and its libraries
  * Access to parts or modifications of quantumj and mathutils libraries (hosted on java.net) for Quantum Chemical calculations
  * Support for Divide and Conquer type algorithms for large scale Quantum Chemical calculations
  * A peer-to-peer networking interface for grouping instances of MeTA studio running on multiple machines to perform varied tasks including computation, rendering and collaboration

To be included:

  * A new Mathematica type interface tailored for computational chemistry
  * A collaborative environment for interaction among computational chemists working on similar problems


Ahead in future:

  * MeTA Studio is not meant to be restricted for use in Computational Chemistry domain, although currently it is more focused towards it. I expect many frameworks in MeTA Studio to expand on to other computational science(s) in near future, with hopefully strong contributions from experts in other fields.
  * I envisage MeTA Studio to be a complete platform for doing computational science, whether it be as a tool, as a programming platform for building new scientific applications, or even as a teaching aid.

**News!**
  * Gave a talk at eResearch Australasia' 09. Have got some pretty interesting feedback here, will be blogging more about these in coming days, which may have quite an impact in the direction that MeTA Studio will head in longer time. The official page is here http://www.eresearch.edu.au/ganesh2009. The slides are here http://tovganesh.googlepages.com/metastudio.pdf.
  * Gave a lightning demo-cum-talk on Talk capabilities of MeTA Studio at OzLabs unconference'09. The (un) slides are [here](http://tovganesh.googlepages.com/meta-for-talk.pdf).
  * Happy to say that a report describing MeTA Studio is published in [J. Comput. Chem.](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jcc.21088) (Volume 30, Pages 661 - 672, 2009). I hope that this brings in more developers and users for the MeTA Studio platform!
