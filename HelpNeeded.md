This project needs voluntary help from those interested for the following:

a) Test out the generic binary package on the latest Mac and post any issues at:
> http://code.google.com/p/metastudio/issues/list

> Also testing it on other operating systems that support JVM (OpenBSD, Solaris etc.)

> (Update: This has been tested now on Intel Mac, see updates on http://code.google.com/p/metastudio/wiki/Installation)

b) If every thing goes right with (a), then make a Mac installer and post it for download.

c) Write User Documentation for MeTA Studio, some parts are already there, but it needs completion.

d) Contribute utilities written in bean shell or jython to http://code.google.com/p/metastudio/wiki/ContributedWidgetsPluginsAndScripts

If you are interested in contributing in any one of the above or any thing relevant to MeTA Studio platform, just drop in a e-mail to me.
