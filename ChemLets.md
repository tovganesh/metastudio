ChemLets are small user written scripts for MeTA Studio. These can be run as it is, or they can be converted to plugins, or if UI is provided, they can be loaded as widgets. ChemLets provide an easy and intutive way to easily extend the IDE to the extent of even building a completely new application that does not resemble MeTA Studio user interface at all!

A number of ChemLets can be found in MeTA Studio installation directory in `meta/scripts` and `meta/widgets` directory.
