Find coordinates of MESP minima manually

1. Go to manage properties, and change the type of the required property to iso-surface.

2. Then change the property value to the value near the required minimum value.

3. Check "Interrogate mode" on the property panel.

4. Now click on the tiny iso-surface to get the coordinates at that point, which will be printed in the "Runtime Log". These coordinates are in angstrom units.
